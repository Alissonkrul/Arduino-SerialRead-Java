How to communicate with an Arduino board using a Java application.

##Intro##
In this example I will show how to read data sending by an Arduino board using Java application.
The Arduino board elaborates a random number and print the data via the serial port. The Java application is designed to find the COM port where the Arduino is connected, establish the connection between Arduino and your PC, read the data coming from the serial port and finally plot the data via a real-time chart using JFreeChart.
